# Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern translates one interface (an objectâ€˜s properties and methods) to another. Adapters allows programming components to work together that otherwise wouldn&lstqup;t because of mismatched interfaces. The Adapter pattern is also referred to as the Wrapper Pattern.

# Used

One scenario where Adapters are commonly used is when new components need to be integrated and work together with existing components in the application.

Another scenario is refactoring in which parts of the program are rewritten with an improved interface, but the old code still expects the original interface.
